# BeInSync - Mutual Mentorship 

# The Challenge

BeInSync is a platform that aims to bridge the gap between students, professionals, tech firms, and schools in Buffalo's tech and startup ecosystem. Our mission is to foster skill development, mentorship, and networking opportunities in this thriving tech community.

One of the key challenges we're addressing is the underrepresentation of women in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce. Currently, women make up only 28% of the STEM workforce, and they are less likely to pursue STEM majors in college, particularly in fields like Computer Science and Engineering.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 29% of American workers have experienced significant career changes, with a significant portion of those changes occurring among individuals under the age of 30. However, navigating such career transitions can be a daunting task.

Additionally, startups often face difficulties in finding qualified talent, with 46% of them struggling to recruit the right candidates. Making a bad hire can cost a startup up to 30% of the first-year earnings, emphasizing the need for efficient and effective talent acquisition strategies.
